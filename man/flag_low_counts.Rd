\title{Flag low counts and set them to NAs}
\usage{
flag_low_counts(x, counts = NULL, threshold = 0.01, set_missing = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \link[incidence2:incidence]{incidence2::incidence} object.}

\item{counts}{A tidyselect compliant indication of the counts to be used.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric multiplier of the median count to be used as
threshold. Defaults to 0.01, in which case any count lower than 1\% of the
median count is flagged as low count.}

\item{set_missing}{A \code{logical} indicating if the low counts identified should
be replaced with NAs (\code{TRUE}, default). If \code{FALSE}, new logical columns
with the \code{flag_low} suffix will be added, indicating which entries are
below the threshold.}
}
\value{
An \link[incidence2:incidence]{incidence2::incidence} object.

\description{
Low counts may be genuine, but they can also reflect actually missing data or
strong under-reporting. This function aims to detect the latter by flagging
any count below a certain threshold, expressed as a fraction of the median
count. Setting low values to NAs can be useful to help fitting temporal
trends to the data, as zeros / low counts can throw off some models
(e.g. Negative Binomial GLMs).
